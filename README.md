# Species Distribution Modeling for Black-bellied Slender Salamander

Independent research project, creating and assessing species distribution models for the Black-bellied Slender Salamander (*Batrachoseps nigriventris*). The goal is to assess the performance of species distribution models given high-resolution raster data over a small spatial scale (6-hectare plots).

## Progress
**Completed** 
1. Manipulated raster data to create a single raster stack of environmental variables that will be used for prediction.
2. Completed a Maxent model for all 8 plots using the default settings for `dismo` Maxent.
3. Used simple models to compare values of background points (MaxEnt only) and k-folds

**In Progress**
1. Improving BRT and MaxEnt model functions for final run to produce select prediction outputs for all 8 plots
