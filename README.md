# Species Distribution Modeling for CA Slender Salamander 
Independent research project, creating and assessing species distribution models for the California Slender salamander (*Batrachoseps attenuatus*). Models were run using the `dismo` package in R.

**Progress**
1. Conducted MaxEnt model using presence-data and environmental variables (heat load index, canopy cover, downed wood, etc.)
2. Currently preparing data for a boosted regression tree model
